# TheMagicFlute.github.io - demo

![deploy status](https://github.com/TheMagicFlute/TheMagicFlute.github.io/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)

## Description

This is a demo of my new personal website, I ready to use Vue3 and Vite to rewrite it.

The old version is still available at [https://themagicflute.github.io](https://themagicflute.github.io).

The new one is [here](https://themagicflute.github.io/demo)

The new version is still in development, and it will replace the old one when it is ready.
